# Informal Introduction to myself

## Myself in a nutshell

- On the internet, friends used to see me as:
  ![penguin](https://github.com/gtb-2022-wang-wanzhi/.github/blob/main/profile/img/1.jpg)
  
  FYI, in this picture, it's called a chinstrap penguin!
- As for me in the real life, let's keep it a secret for now. One day you can see me in person :D

## My interests
- Firstly, I enjoy most kinds of movies, except for romantic movies. Horror and action ones are preferable.
- Also, I watch football games. Consequently, you may find me awake at 4 am sometimes.
- Give me a chance to show off players that I like!
