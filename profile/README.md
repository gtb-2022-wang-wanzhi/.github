# an Informal Introduction

## Myself in a nutshell

- On the internet, friends are used to see me as:
  ![penguin]()
  
  FYI, in this picture, it's called a chinstrap penguin!
- As for me in the real life, let's keep it a secret for now. One day you can see me in person :D

## My interests
- Firstly, I enjoy most kinds of movies, except for romantic movies.   
  
  **Horror and action ones are preferable!**

- Also, I watch football games. Consequently, you may find me awake at 4 am sometimes.
  
  Give me a chance to show off players that I like!
